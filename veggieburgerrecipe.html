            <h2> Instructions</h2>
            
<ol>
    <h4>Prepare veggies and beans</h4>
    <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line two rimmed baking sheets with foil, parchment paper or silicon baking mats.</li>
    
    <li>Using a damp paper towel, brush all dirt from mushrooms. Cut away and discard any hard stems. Roughly chop the mushrooms, carrot, broccoli and onion into 1/2-inch chunks. Toss vegetables into the bowl of a food processor. Add the garlic, olive oil, smoked paprika, chili powder, salt and pepper. Close the lid and pulse 10 to 20 times until coarsely ground.</li> 
    
    <li>Spread the ground vegetables onto one of the lined baking sheets. Pat them down with a spatula until a very thin layer of vegetables covers the majority of the baking sheet. Roast the vegetables for 15 minutes. (If the veggies around the outer edges start to turn dark brown, stir and press them back down into a thin layer).</li>
    
    <li>Meanwhile, spread the drained black beans onto the second baking sheet in one layer. When the vegetables have roasted for 15 minutes, stir them and press into a thin layer once more. Transfer both baking sheets (vegetables and the black beans) to the oven. Roast until the beans begin to split and look dry and the vegetables look drier and toasted, about 15 minutes. Let everything cool.</li> 
    
    
    <h4>Make burger mix</h4>
    <li>While the beans and vegetables roast, rinse the food processor bowl and pat dry</li> 
    
    <li>Place the walnuts, spinach and fresh herbs in it. Pulse until they are about the size of breadcrumbs.</li> 
    
    <li>Add cooled beans and pulse 5 to 10 times until the beans look crumbly with large crumbs.</li> 
    
    <li>Add the roasted vegetables, panko breadcrumbs, eggs and the tomato paste. Pulse until everything is just combined. You want to keep some texture, don’t pulse until a smooth mixture.</li> 
    
    <li>Scrape the mixture into a bowl and fold in the rice.</li> 
    
    <li>Refrigerate the veggie burger mix up to 24 hours. Or make patties, cook them and freeze wrapped in foil up to 3 months.</li> 
    
    <h4>Cook Burgers</h4>
    <li>When you are ready to make the burgers, divide into 8 equal portions (about 3 1/4 ounces or 90 grams each). Form each portion into a 1/2-inch thick patty</li>
    
    <li>Heat a skillet over medium-low heat, add oil, and then place patties in one layer. (We use about 1 tablespoon of oil to cook 4 burgers). Cook until heated through, firm and browned on both sides, about 4 to 6 minutes on each side. If any bits fall from the sides as you flip, press them back into the sides of the patty. Be careful when flipping so they stay together.</li>
    
    <li>For an outdoor grill, we recommend placing a cast iron pan or griddle over a low fire to cook the burgers.</li>
    
    <li>To reheat frozen cooked burgers: Bake in a 350 degree F oven until heated through, 15 to 20 minutes. Or reheat in a skillet over medium-low heat until heated through, 5 to 10 minutes on each side. We do not recommend microwaving the patties (they steam and become floppy).</li>
    
    <h4>Adam and Joanne's tips</h4>
    
    <li>One (15-ounce) can of beans has approximately 2 1/3 cups or 255 grams of beans.</li>
    
    <li>Other beans work for this recipe. Try cannellini beans, kidney beans and chickpeas.</li>
    
    <li>Cooking brown rice: We love the texture and flavor of brown rice, but you can use white rice in its place. To cook brown rice, forget the package directions and cook it like you would pasta. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water, add the brown rice then let it cook, uncovered, at a simmer for 30 minutes. Drain the rice then add back to the pot off of the heat with a lid covering it so that it steams for an additional 10 minutes. This method is from Saveur and it really does make perfect brown rice.</li>
    
    <li>Vegan / egg-free veggie burgers: If you don’t eat eggs, you can leave the eggs out and use flax eggs as a substitute. Whisk 2 tablespoons flaxseed meal with 6 tablespoons water. Set the mixture aside for 5 to 10 minutes, and then use in the recipe to replace the eggs.</li>
